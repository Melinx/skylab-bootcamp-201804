# els Gerds - Project App

## App description

This project is based on an actual store that sells home-cooked meals for lunch. The main purpose of this app is on one hand, to help the store manage their orders on a daily basis. On the other hand, the customer would be avoiding lines and planning their meals ahead. It is not quite an e-commerce since it targets lunch meals only on a daily basis and there's no delivery.

For now, the only functionality of this app is to place same-day lunch orders.
